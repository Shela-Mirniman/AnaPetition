We signater of this document, ask that Anamorphose for her work in creating Arche Terre and taking care of it. Even all this is clouded in the current tension around Arche Terre. We believe that honoring the one that contributed to Arche Terre should be rewarded. So we propose that:

1) Anamorphose receive the offer to come back as builder for Arche Terre if she want it.
2) Is formally honored on the forum as founder of Arche Terre.

Alchemist/Pablo   I had a lot of fun in our different rp, and relation with the years is it on Solarune or Sinfar. I still remember when you use Sinfar as inspiration for Solarune.

I, Criimstar add my vote for yes please.
